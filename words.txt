I have the following function that takes 3 pieces of information (name, age, hometown) for 3 people and saves it in a txt file.

def peopleInfo():
    txtFile = open("info.txt", "w")
    i = 0
    for i in range(0, 3):
        name = input("Enter name ")
        age = input("Enter age ")
        hometown = input("Enter hometown ")
        txtFile.write(name + "\n" + age + "\n" + hometown + "\n")
    txtFile.close()

I am now trying to create a function that will read the text file and print a persons name if their hometown is 'Oxford'. So far I have the following just to read the text from the file but im not sure how to skip back a line and print the name if the town is Oxford.

def splitLine():
    txtFile = open("info.txt", "r")
    for line in txtFile:
        line = line.rstrip("\n")
        print(line)

Thanks for any help!

    why are you storing a person's info in separate lines? use , or tab â€“ karthikr Mar 28 '13 at 14:31
